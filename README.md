# Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to review my solution to your assessment. 

Having been involved in many interviews with candidates, I have always appreciated it when someone approached the assessment in a way that resulted in an informative or beneficial conversation or review.

I hope you enjoy reviewing it as much as I did putting it together!

> _Side Note_: I have been verbose with my documentation, hoping to provide insight into my goals, decisions, and thought process. 

# Documentation included in this repository
